# Windows Tools

This will help you install a C++ compiler (Clang), a build engine (Ninja), and CMake on Windows right here with one command.

## Usage

Open VSCode to the project, open a terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal), and run `& ./wintools/install-env.bat`.

(This will take quite some time to finish.)

## Uninstalling

When you don't need the repository-local Clang, Ninja, and CMake anymore, open VSCode to the project, open a terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal), and run `& ./wintools/uninstall-env.bat`.
